Most of the commits in this repository correspond to videos in the program.

2. Go into the directory where the project now lives - `cd reactnd-contacts-complete`
3. Install the dependencies - `npm install`
4. Start the app - `npm start`

## Contributing

Because this is a code-along project and the commits correspond to specific videos in the program, we will not be accepting pull requests.

If you feel like there's a major problem, please open an issue to discuss the problem and potential resolution.
